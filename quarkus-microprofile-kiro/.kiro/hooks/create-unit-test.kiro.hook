If it contains significant business logic (not just a record, enum, exception, or simple data class), create a corresponding unit test class in the appropriate test directory. Follow project conventions: use AssertJ assertions, avoid \"test\" or \"should\" prefixes in method names, and generate at most three essential tests. Skip test generation for boundary classes (JAX-RS resources), health checks, and trivial implementations."
